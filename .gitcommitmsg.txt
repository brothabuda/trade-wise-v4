[Fix]: Correct reminder/tracker popup sequence and UI

[Details]:
- What changed:
    - `TimerContext.tsx`: Refactored popup presentation logic using a ref to ensure emotional tracker appears only after reminder dismissal or if no reminder was due.
    - `EmotionalTracker.tsx`: Updated label for custom tracking interval to "Custom interval (plays every X timer completions)".
    - `TimerDashboard.tsx`: Ensured `EmotionalTracker` settings card is only visible when the timer is idle.
    - `App.tsx`: Updated `TimerProvider` import for default export.
- Why it changed:
    - To fix bug where emotional tracker would show before reminder was dismissed.
    - To improve clarity of UI text for emotional tracking settings.
    - To improve UX by hiding irrelevant settings during an active timer.
- How it changed:
    - Used `useRef` in `TimerContext.tsx` for more reliable state checking between `playBellSequence` and `handleSequenceComplete`.
    - Conditional rendering in `TimerDashboard.tsx` based on timer status.
